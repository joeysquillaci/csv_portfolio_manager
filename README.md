The CSV portfolio manager was an idea inspired by my own manual tracking of investments and financial data. The goal is to create a program 
that can store, summarize, and manipulate financial data for analyzation purposes.

Initial iterations include seeing current balances, all balances, and adding an entry to the CSV file. 
Future iterations include creating graphs of data, analyzing data, removing entries, and more.

File structure:
  - portfolio.py : main program
  - CSV : a folder to store test CSV data files
  - menu_funcs : a folder containing external functions that can be called from the main menu
  - helper_funcs : a folder containing external functions that assist in the primary menu function processes
